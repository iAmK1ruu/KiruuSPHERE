# KiruuSphere üåê

### KiruuSphere is a simple and intuitive weather application built using JavaFX. It leverages the Open-Meteo Weather API to provide real-time weather updates and conditions for any location around the globe. With a user-friendly interface, it aims to help users stay updated with current weather and forecast information.

## Current Development UI
- Code refactoring in progress to optimize performance especially on WebView.
- A bug that prevents the app from being opened due to being unable to retrieve news data (which persists when there is no Internet connection), is to be resolved
